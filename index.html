        <p class="col-9">Hi, I'm Seh Cheong NG, and I graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2015 with a degree in Life Science. My interests are in Front End Engineering, and I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences. I previously worked at Company X, where I led the XYZ project. XYZ was a service for companies to make urban transportation expenses convenient. Companies can create employee groups, set ride policies, and share corporate payment methods with their employees. I built the project with two other engineers over the period of three months using Python and SQL. I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role at Company XYZ because I like working in this ridesharing space and creating products to improve the lives of users.</p>
